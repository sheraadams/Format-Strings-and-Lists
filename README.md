# Format-Strings-and-Lists

Take input separated by comma, and remove the commas and unwanted characters. 

Or in reverse, take input without quotes, add quotes to each item again removing unwanted characters.

Go to application for modifying lists, removing all quotes from items, modifying contents then returning the modified list back to list format for use in python etc.
